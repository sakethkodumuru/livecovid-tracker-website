# livecovid-tracker-website
api used for this project-"https://api.covid19india.org/data.json"
This api contains data of no.of cases reported daily in india and the cases count statewise,i had used only the statewise cases data and using javascript functions fetched the data and displayed it in the table containing columns of statename,activecases in that state,total confirmed cases,deaths and the number of people recovered.I had added a search feature so that user can directly search for the state required and can obtain the data of that particular state. 
This project is deployed in heroku websitelink-"https://live-covid-tracker-india.herokuapp.com" for deploying in heroku i had used a php file to render the index.html file.
